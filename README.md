# Challenge 4: Web APIs Challenge: Code Quiz

This week, I was not given a starter code and was challenged with created a code quiz that starts off with a main screen that describes the process of the quiz, and provides a start button to begin the quiz. Once the start button is clicked, it will then clear the original screen content and show the first quiz question along with its possible answer options. At the same time as the start quiz button is pressed, a timer should begin to countdown, representing the time remaining that the user has to complete the quiz. Every time an answer is selected, it brings you to the next question, and if answered wrong, it subtracts 10 second of time from the timer as a penalty. Once done with the quiz, the user should be able to enter their initials along with their final score, which is represented by the time remaining in the timer when the quiz was completed. These values should then be able to be saved to local storage, and when the submit button is clicked, it shows a new page that lists the high scores.
